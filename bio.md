I am passionate about developing software for more than 20 years now and
currently have the privilege to head the first Bosch Internal Open Source
Community at Bosch. Before joining Bosch, I worked with the Line Information
software consultancy in Hamburg, the Zurich System House in Cologne and Daimler
research in Ulm. I studied computer science at the Karlsruhe Institute of
Technology and the University of Massachussetts at Dartmouth, USA.
